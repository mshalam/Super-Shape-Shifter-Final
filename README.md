Project title: SUPER SHAPE SHIFTER

Overview:

Our project is a multi-level timed game where players have to tap shapes to earn a specified amount of points within an allotted period of time. The most basic shape is a square, which when tapped turns into a hexagon, which then converts into an octagon, which then loops back into squares.

The screen format shall consist of a grid of randomized shapes.

The difficulty for the player will be from both the time constraint, and trying not to hit bombs. If they player hits bombs, they lose points.

#Created for IOS Programming at NYU
In this course, we will learn to create applications for Apple’s iOS on both the iPhone and the iPad using Objective-C, Apple's new programming language Swift, and the iOS SDK.

Since its introduction, the Apple iOS SDK has proved to be a powerful platform upon which to build sophisticated applications. Without actually having to own an iPhone or an iPad, students will be able to build and test their applications on Intel Apple Macs using the freely available compiler and simulator. Students will become proficient in the object-oriented language Objective-C,  Swift, Apple iOS Frameworks,  and the XCode development environment.  This is a new, dynamic, constantly-evolving topic, and students will be at the forefront a new technological advancement.
