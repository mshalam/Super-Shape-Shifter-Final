# Super-Shape-Shifter-Final
In this course, we will learn to create applications for Apple’s iOS on both the iPhone and the iPad using Objective-C, Apple's new programming language Swift, and the iOS SDK.

Since its introduction, the Apple iOS SDK has proved to be a powerful platform upon which to build sophisticated applications. Without actually having to own an iPhone or an iPad, students will be able to build and test their applications on Intel Apple Macs using the freely available compiler and simulator. Students will become proficient in the object-oriented language Objective-C,  Swift, Apple iOS Frameworks,  and the XCode development environment.  This is a new, dynamic, constantly-evolving topic, and students will be at the forefront a new technological advancement.
